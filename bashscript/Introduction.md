#  Introduction to Bash Scripting
- Bash scripting is used to automate repetitive tasks, manipulate files, and process data efficiently within Linux systems.  
- It’s a key DevOps skill that enables control, flexibility, and automation across the command line.

##  What is Bash?
- Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command interpreter and scripting language. It executes commands from user input or from a file (a script).
- A typical Bash script starts with a **shebang line** — this tells the system which interpreter should execute the file.
- ```bash
#!/bin/bash
