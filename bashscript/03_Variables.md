#  Variables in Bash
- Variables are used to store and reuse data within a script. They make scripts flexible and easier to maintain.

##  Creating Variables
- Variables are declared without spaces around the `=` sign:
`name="Abdi"`
`age=25`
- To display the value of a variable, prefix it with $:
`echo "Hello, $name! You are $age years old."`

## Example Script
`course="Linux Bash Scripting"`
`echo "Welcome to the $course module!"`
The script will print:
`Welcome to the Linux Bash Scripting module!`
