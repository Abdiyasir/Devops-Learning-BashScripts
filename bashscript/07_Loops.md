# Loops in Bash
- Loops allow you to repeat commands or processes automatically.
- This is essential for automation, iteration, and handling multiple files or inputs.

## `for` Loop
- This is used to iterate through a sequence of items.
```
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Count: $i"
done
```
- Result:
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```
