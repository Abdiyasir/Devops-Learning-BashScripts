# The Basics
- Create a directory named Arena_Boss and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. List the contents of the Arena directory.
```
touch script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
mkdir -p Arena_Boss

cd Arena_Boss

touch warrior.txt
touch mage.txt
touch archer.txt

ls
```
